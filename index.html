        <h2>Romaine Cridland</h2>
        <p>"Computer Science student who strive with diligence and creativity. Introvert by heart
            but will rise to the occasions if needed. Prefer to linger around my PC most days watching
            series, playing games or editing. If I am not doing any of the sort my head is stuck in a book
            reading one of my favourite titles. My mind sees the world as it is, however it is flooded with 
            colours".
